# Project BAGEL: Bio-inspired Architecture for General Engineered Lattices

## Overview

Project BAGEL represents a groundbreaking approach to designing microscopic drug delivery systems using toroidal (bagel-shaped) structures. Our research investigates how these unique geometries can be utilized to create more efficient and targeted therapeutic delivery mechanisms.

## The Science Behind It

Toroidal structures offer several advantages over traditional spherical or cylindrical nanoparticles:

- **Enhanced Surface Area**: The toroidal shape provides a larger surface-to-volume ratio, allowing for more efficient drug loading and release.
- **Stability**: The unique geometry provides structural stability in biological environments.
- **Targeting Capabilities**: The shape can be engineered to interact specifically with certain cell types.

## Recent Breakthroughs

In our latest publication in *Nature Nanotechnology*, we demonstrated that self-assembling bagel structures can be created using a novel soft matter approach. The structures form spontaneously under specific conditions, making them highly reproducible and scalable.

## Applications

- **Targeted Cancer Therapy**: The toroidal structures can be functionalized to target specific cancer cells.
- **Gene Delivery**: The unique shape allows for efficient encapsulation and delivery of genetic material.
- **Vaccine Development**: Potential applications in creating more effective vaccine delivery systems.

## Future Directions

We are currently exploring:
- Multi-layered toroidal structures for sequential drug release
- Integration with quantum dots for imaging and therapy
- Biocompatibility studies in various biological models

## Research Team

This project is led by Dr. Freeman with key contributions from postdoctoral researcher Alyx V. and PhD student Gordon B.
